# Reading Reflection: January 9th

## Ben Shneiderman, 2002, Creativity Support Tools

The framework of four activities Ben proposed reminds me of what I learned in the past year's researching experience. __Collect__ - literature research, the most basic yet vital work. __Relate__ - the constant discussion with the mentor. __Create__ - the coding, debugging, testing, more coding, and more testing process. __Donate__ - the published paper, as a contribution to human knowledge. 

Ben also pointed out that this is not a linear process. Indeed, I frequently revisit the Collect step - new papers published, older, but more relevant papers discovered. If we were well prepared in the Collect step, life would be much easier in the following steps.

The idea of "a specific tool to support the annotate-consult-revise" process sounds reasonable. But I believe from the business perspective, or the value is worthy of the developer's time perspective, finding the particular processes worth making a tool is the actual challenge.

Many of the ideas, examples mentioned by Ben is not fresh. Some are so used to by modern internet users. But it is a good reminder that this paper was published in 2002, a time when high-speed internet was rare to find. It predicted how some of the daily tools should be today from almost 20 years ago. It is worth thinking about what we could predict today for 20 years later. And that might be things we should work towards.

This article is my first reading of this domain. The field of HCI is so broad; I feel that the reader must create her/his context to resonate with the writer. It is difficult for me, in the beginning, to appreciate what the writer is talking about. Only when the context and examples get more evident and more concrete, I could agree/disagree with some of the text.

## Hennessey and Amabile, 2010, Cretivity

"People are most creative when they are motivated primarily by the interest, enjoyment, satisfaction, and challenge of the work itself - i.e., by intrinsic motivation." Here I quote point 6 from the authors' summary. I don't feel strong agreement or disagreement with previous points, but the psychologists got this one right. Readers would relate to personal experience at this point, something they felt strongly motivated in a period of their lives, and often the energy driving people to focus is intrinsic rather than external pressure.

I could still remember many sleepless nights developing websites when I was a teenager. There was no external pressure, or reward, just pure enjoyment of watching code turning into graphics. Studying textbooks was not my thing, at least not until after I worked for five years. The external environment was very comfortable, flexible working hours, corporate perks, travel per diems. But the internal anxious knowing that life will be largely the same in the foreseeable future started to drain my creativity. Leaving my comfort zone seemed to be an irrational decision to my mum, but it only proved my point. That stable but unchanged life my parent generation wanted is exactly what I tried to avoid.
