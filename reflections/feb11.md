## What Do Prototypes Prototype?

The model of the three-dimensional prototypes, namely the role, look and feel, and implementation is suitable for teamwork. The paper suggests that a project could have separate prototypes at each dimension or different stages. A project supported by people with specific roles would prototype based on their responsibility/contribution. 

However, for solo developers, the three types of prototypes are often highly interrelated (the integration design). A solo developer needs to consider all three dimensions almost from the very beginning, because a miscalculated design in any of the three aspects could sink the project. Still, the model is inspiring as a way to plan and evaluate a project from three perspectives, even for a solo developer. 

We saw in deep learning papers that the same model could have different figure representations to demonstrate different perspectives. Often the author would use a simple overview of the entire data pipeline to highlight which of the steps this paper focused on (the role). Then a more details figure would show the technical details that made this a novel contribution (the implementation). Often there are results comparisons to materialize an abstract model (the look and feel).

Again, a clear purpose for each prototype is vital to make design decisions better. It is also crucial to remember that prototypes are not self-explanatory, effective and clear communication with the audience actually put the prototypes to work.
