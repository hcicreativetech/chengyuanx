## Social Creativity: Turning Barriers into Opportunities for Collaborative Design 

Having a hard time understanding the concept of "Boundary Objects," I searched for answers in my own language. Surprisingly among the limited search results, some discussion is about the proper translation for the term. The scarcity of useful results from multiple search engines make the term itself the best, or the worst, example to demonstrate barriers in conceptual communication - a frequently cited sociology term failed to generate a precise definition in another language. 

I could think of two theories to explain this failure. First, the Chinese sociology community failed to accept or popularize the idea of Boundary Objects, leading to a lack of information and discussion. The second theory,  the sociology community coined another term or translation for the same idae, but only shared within the community of the same practice,  leaving a barrier for outsiders to understand.

I do find one viable explanation in the end. In a popular science blog, the author borrowed the term, with a literal translation, to make the point that some rock bands are in fact masters in science communication. 

Songwriters sometimes name their songs or albums with popular scientific ideas. There are songs named DNA, Gravity, or Darwin, and the lyrics often include related ideas like evolution. Not all the lyrics used the science words accurately, but those words served as the boundary object to communicate between communities of common interest. In this case, the passion for music helped popularize and informed scientific ideas.  This seven years old blog post also served as the boundary object to help me understand a sociology concept.
