## Lessons from the Woodshop
The research method in this paper indeed provided detailed observations and some generalized reflections, with the hope that such generalized ideas could transfer the lessons from one domain to another, from analog to digital, from physical to virtual. But in reality, it often requires a practitioner to understand one's own medium, tools, or domain knowledge very well to be able to build the connection between general rules and specific objective/practice for improved applications. 

Working with "non-living materials," I failed to make similar connections to my medium at this very moment. I could imagine that one day one of the lessons, particularly the idea that "the fir (the material) is an active co-designer with a rich life of its own to be understood and grappled with" might strike me and reveal some sudden revelation. But it is through the expert guidance and personal, intimate touching with the material that the authors came to this conclusion. For many practitioners working with the objective/scientific data as material, without the artistic/personal touch, such revelation might never come.

## Hybrid Practice in the Kalahari

Comparing to the eighteen-month long woodshop learning experience, the research adventure in the Kalahari carried more risks and unknowns. The distance, the cultural difference, and the technological barrier on top of the communication barrier all worked against generating a confident expectation before arrival. 

Woodworking is a familiar craft that we lack in-depth knowledge. By observing experienced practitioners solving specific challenges, especially the tricks and their thinking in the long run, the authors conclude lessons that might benefit others. The key there is observing and summary. However, the hybrid practice with Ju/'hoansi, in my opinion, is more like conducting a sociological research using digital and conventional crafting techniques as the lens. The process to prepare, to convince, and conducting the workshop with two communities is enchanting. The hunter-gather society almost served as a mirror to reflect the primal needs of city dwellers, opened a portal to converse with our ancestors.
	One of the conclusions - "encourage working collectively rather than individually" reminded me of a massive social experiment on Reddit called Place.  I had a fuzzy idea to make a similar collaborative project that takes place on campus. If we allow each passerby in front of an interactive screen to make one change to a lump of digital modeling clay, it would be an interesting way to observe the various shared values between different communities.

## Do-It-Yourself Cellphones

This paper might be an interesting blog post. I do not deny the challenges or the quality of the DIY phone; the authors obvisouly put much thought into open sourcing and organizing workshops. But, the reading experience is far from enjoyable. Maybe because my expectation to the subject is too high, yet the writers' shallow analysis is like my level, writing in a second language. 

## Sidenote

The woodshop paper vividly demonstrated a few fresh ideas that I resonated with. In particular, "countering excessive resource extraction" and "resources stewardship" reminded me of Bitcoin. Many early adopters like myself found the idea of a decentralized currency a powerful seed against big government. But speculation and cheap resources quickly centralized mining (China dominated 60-70% of global mining power in the past three years). Bitcoin mining became a meanless, wasteful energy consumption activity.
