# Reading Reflection: January 16th

## Mindstorms

There has been a consensus that the school education in China is a typical "teaching-that/knowing-that" system. An easy explanation is based on the fact that the majority of our population needs better access to formal knowledge, before the resources could afford customized education that inspires students to challenge their intuitions. But it can not deny the fact that some educators had tried.

Most of my learning experience in school, especially as a teenager, had a positive correlation between the teacher's teaching style and my performance at the subject. The textbook is carefully curated in a controlled doze, a rather fair game for everyone. However, most of my least interested subjects in junior high, the dark age of my short life, later became my favorite topics in high school, college, or graduate school. Should I blame the textbook, the teacher, or myself for failing before? Or did I just needed more time, until things "clicked" in a new domain of knowledge?

One experience I learned almost only recently, is that given enough time and patience, anyone can learn anything. One improvement worth trying is a better evaluation system, comparing to mid-terms and finals, that could let students to pace the chapters themselves, so no one have to encounter the suffering of left behind.
